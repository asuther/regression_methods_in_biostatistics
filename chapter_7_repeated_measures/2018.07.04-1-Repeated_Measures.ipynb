    "**Background: **A lack of digestive enzymes in the intestines can cause absorption problems, leading to excess fat in the feces. Pancreatic enzymes can be given to ameliorate the problem. Data was collected using multiple types of pills, including placebo, a normal tablet, an uncoated capsule, and a coated capsule. Each patient was given each type of pill and their fecal fat grams per day was measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can think of this as a repeated measures study, since each patient has four measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only predictor in this case is the pill type, and the outcome is the (continuous) variable of fecal fat in g/day. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose: **To identify what the best pill type is for reducing fecal fat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods: **First, I will follow the example of the chapter and try an ANOVA test\n",
